## Redux Toolkit's role

### Centralized task management:

The "todo_task" Redux slice acts as a centralized and well-structured hub for managing task state.

The TaskList interface provides a blueprint for maintaining consistency and clarity in representing tasks.

Reducers act as specialized helpers, each with a different role in creating, updating, and deleting functions.

Redux slices improve the flexibility of task management, providing seamless integration and efficient handling of operations related to an application's task.
